# üçΩÔ∏è PrepLights

**Smart, reactive kitchen lighting powered by ESP32, sensors, and thermal vision.**

PrepLights is a modular, sci-fi-inspired lighting system that responds to your presence, your appliances, and your cooking flow. Built with ESPHome, Raspberry Pi, and addressable LED strips, it turns your kitchen into a high-functioning interactive workspace.

## üöÄ Features

* **Zone-based motion tracking** using VL53L0X ToF sensors
* **Heat-reactive glow** above kettle using MLX90640 thermal camera
* **Slow cooker countdown timer LED bar**
* **Food-prep zones that react to motion or match the food‚Äôs colour**
* **Ambient sync lighting across all under-cabinet sections**
* **Modular ESP32 nodes for each kitchen segment**
* **MQTT & Home Assistant integration**
* **Wi-Fi OTA updates + Web dashboard**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Install ESPHome on your Linux machine using pipx or a venv
2. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youruser/preplights.git
   cd preplights
   ```
3. Flash an ESP32 with the starter config:

   ```bash
   esphome run preplights.yaml
   ```
4. Connect it to Wi-Fi and access it over ESPHome or HA
5. Expand zone configs as hardware arrives
